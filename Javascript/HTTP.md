Sure, here are 20 concepts related to HTTP in JavaScript:

1. [[HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)]] - HTTP is a protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It's the foundation of any data exchange on the Web.

2. [[HTTPS]] - HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an extension of HTTP. It's used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the internet.

3. [[HTTP Request Methods]] - There are several HTTP request methods, including GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data), among others.

4. [[HTTP Status Codes]] - HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. They are categorized in five classes: informational responses, successful responses, redirection messages, client error responses, and server error responses.

5. [[AJAX]] - AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) is a set of web development techniques that use many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications. With AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.

6. [[Fetch API]] - Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.

7. [[XMLHttpRequest]] - XMLHttpRequest is an API in the form of an object that provides client functionality for transferring data between a client and a server.

8. [[Headers]] - HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response.

9. [[Cookies]] - HTTP cookies are small piece of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website, and they can be sent back to the server with HTTP requests.

10. [[CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)]] - CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin.

11. [[JSON]] - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data interchange format and is often used with HTTP requests.

12. [[HTTP2]] - HTTP/2 is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web, which offers performance improvements over HTTP/1.

13. [[Websockets]] - Websockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, often used as a more interactive alternative to HTTP.

14. [[HTTP Caching]] - HTTP caching is an important part of optimizing for performance. When properly implemented, it allows client to store responses for reuse, reducing network traffic.

15. [[Query Parameters]] - Query parameters are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a url, which are used to share context information and control the details of the HTTP request.

16. [[REST]] - REST (Representational State Transfer) is a standard architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses a stateless, client-server communication model, and HTTP specifically for transferring data.

17. [[HTTP3]] - HTTP/3 is the upcoming third major version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which uses QUIC instead of TCP for transport to improve performance.

18. [[Axios]] - Axios is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from a web browser. It supports the Promise API and is more flexible and capable than the native Fetch API.

19. [[FormData]] - The FormData API provides a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can then be sent using the XMLHttpRequest.send() method.

20. [[Content Negotiation]] - Content negotiation is a mechanism defined in the HTTP specification that makes it possible to serve different versions of a document (or more generally, a resource representation) at the same URI, so that user agents can specify which version fit their capabilities the best.
