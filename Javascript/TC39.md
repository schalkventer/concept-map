Sure, here are 20 concepts related to TC39 (Technical Committee 39) in JavaScript:

1. [[TC39]] - TC39 (Technical Committee 39) is the committee that evolves JavaScript. Its members include various large web companies and front-end framework authors.

2. [[ECMAScript]] - ECMAScript is the standardized specification of the scripting language developed by TC39. JavaScript is the most widely used implementation of ECMAScript.

3. [[TC39 Proposal Stages]] - TC39 has a 5 stage process (0-4) for evolving the ECMAScript specification, from inception to acceptance.

4. [[Stage 0 Strawperson]] - This is the conception stage where a new feature is considered for the language.

5. [[Stage 1 Proposal]] - A formal proposal is made at this stage with API examples and a high-level overview of the semantics and algorithms.

6. [[Stage 2 Draft]] - A first version of what will be in the specification. The feature is expected to be developed and maintained.

7. [[Stage 3 Candidate]] - The proposal is mostly finished and now needs feedback from implementations and users to progress further.

8. [[Stage 4 Finished]] - The proposal is ready for inclusion in the standard. It has been tested in a variety of implementations and has comprehensive test suites.

9. [[ES2015, ES2016...]] - These are different versions of the ECMAScript standard which are the result of the TC39 process. They include ES6/ES2015, ES2016, ES2017, etc.

10. [[ECMAScript Proposals]] - ECMAScript proposals are changes or features that are proposed to the standard language specification.

11. [[Babel]] - Babel is a popular JavaScript transpiler that allows developers to use features from future versions of JavaScript in their current projects. Many features are implemented in Babel before they reach stage 4 in TC39's process.

12. [[Test262]] - Test262 is a test suite maintained by TC39 that tests JavaScript engine's conformance to the ECMAScript standard.

13. [[ECMA International]] - TC39 is a part of ECMA International, an industry association dedicated to the standardization of information and communication systems.

14. [[Yearly Release Cycle]] - TC39 has a yearly release cycle for ECMAScript standard versions.

15. [[Polyfills]] - Polyfills are pieces of code that implement features on platforms that do not natively support them. They are often used for features that are in the proposal process.

16. [[Specification Text]] - Part of the process for a proposal is to provide an "English description" of the language feature, which is used to specify exactly how JavaScript engines should implement it.

17. [[Implementers]] - Implementers are members of TC39 who take on the task of implementing the specification in JavaScript engines such as V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), and JavaScriptCore (Safari).

18. [[Community Input]] - Community input is a crucial part of the TC39 process. Proposals often start as community discussions and require community feedback as they are developed.

19. [[Backward Compatibility]] - TC39 makes a commitment to backward compatibility. This means new versions of ECMAScript will not break JavaScript code running on older versions.

20. [[TC39 Meetings]] - TC39 meets regularly to discuss and work on the proposals. The meetings are attended by the members of TC39, invited experts, and guests.
