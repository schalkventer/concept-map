Sure, here are 20 concepts related to objects in JavaScript along with brief summaries:

1. [[Object Definition in JavaScript]] - An object is a standalone entity with properties and types in JavaScript. It's an unordered collection of related data in the form of key:value pairs.

2. [[Creating Objects]] - Objects can be created using object literals (e.g., `let obj = {}`), the `new Object()` constructor, or `Object.create()`.

3. [[Object Properties]] - Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object. A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.

4. [[Accessing Object Properties]] - You can access properties of an object using dot notation (`object.property`) or bracket notation (`object['property']`).

5. [[Objects and 'this' Keyword]] - The `this` keyword in the context of an object method refers to the object the method is called on.

6. [[Object Methods]] - Object methods are functions that are associated with an object and typically manipulate the data in the object.

7. [[Prototype Objects]] - Every JavaScript object has a second JavaScript object (or null, but this is rare) associated with it. This second object is known as a prototype, and the first object inherits properties from the prototype.

8. [[Object Prototypal Inheritance]] - JavaScript objects can inherit properties from their prototype, allowing for the sharing of methods and properties from a common prototype.

9. [[Objects and Loops]] - You can use loops, such as the `for...in` loop, to iterate over the properties of an object.

10. [[Object Destructuring]] - Destructuring assignment syntax allows you to unpack properties from objects into distinct variables.

11. [[Adding and Modifying Object Properties]] - You can add new properties to an object, or modify existing ones, by simply assigning a value to a property with the assignment operator (`=`).

12. [[Deleting Object Properties]] - The `delete` operator allows you to remove a property from an object.

13. [[Object Constructors]] - An object constructor is a function used with the `new` keyword to create new objects. The constructor's name usually starts with a capital letter to distinguish it from other functions.

14. [[Object Instances]] - An instance of an object is created by calling a constructor function with the `new` keyword.

15. [['hasOwnProperty' Method]] - The `hasOwnProperty()` method allows you to check if an object has a particular property.

16. [['Object.keys' and 'Object.values' Methods]] - `Object.keys()` and `Object.values()` methods allow you to retrieve an array of an object's property names or values, respectively.

17. [[Getters and Setters]] - Getters and setters are functions or methods used to get and set the values of variables. The `get` and `set` keywords are used for defining getters and setters in objects.

18. [['Object.assign' Method]] - The `Object.assign()` method is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

19. [[Immutable Objects]] - JavaScript objects are mutable by default, but they can be made immutable by using methods like `Object.freeze()`.

20. [[JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)]] - JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data, which is just a text written in JavaScript object notation.
