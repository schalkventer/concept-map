Of course, here are 20 concepts related to functions in JavaScript along with brief summaries: A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task and it is defined with the function keyword.

2. [[Scope in JavaScript Functions]] - Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code.

3. [[Function Hoisting]] - Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their current scope, unlike function expressions.

4. [[Function Expressions]] - A function expression is a function defined inside an expression and can be anonymous.

5. [[Arrow Functions]] - Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a compact syntax to create functions and lexically bind the `this` value.

6. [[Higher-Order Functions]] - These are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results.

7. [[Callback Functions]] - Callbacks are functions passed into another function as an argument to be executed later.

8. [[Pure Functions and Side Effects]] - A pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its input and it doesn't cause any side effects.

9. [[Recursion in Functions]] - Recursion is the concept where a function calls itself in its definition.

10. [[Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)]] - IIFEs are functions that are executed as soon as they are defined.

11. [[Closures in Functions]] - A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope.

12. [[Generator Functions]] - Generators are special kinds of functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing other code to run during the "pauses".

13. [[Async Functions and Promises]] - Async functions are a syntax sugar over promises in JavaScript and make asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code.

14. [[Function Currying]] - Currying is a transformation of functions that translates a function from callable as f(a, b, c) into callable as f(a)(b)(c).

15. [[Partial Application of Functions]] - Partial application refers to the process of fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function of smaller arity.

16. [[Function Composition]] - Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.

17. [[Methods in JavaScript]] - Methods are functions that are stored as object properties.

18. [[Function Constructors]] - JavaScript functions can also be defined using a Function constructor.

19. [[Rest Parameters and Spread Syntax in Functions]] - Rest parameters and spread syntax are features that allow functions to accept any number of arguments.

20. [[Default Parameters in Functions]] - Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.
