1. [[Class Definition in JavaScript]] - Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

2. [[Constructor Method]] - The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created within a class.

3. [[Creating Instances]] - An instance of a class can be created using the `new` keyword followed by the class name.

4. [[Instance Properties]] - Properties added to an object instance are not shared between instances of a class. They should be set inside the constructor method.

5. [[Class Methods]] - Methods are functions defined on the class's prototype. They are shared between all instances of a class.

6. [[The `this` Keyword in Classes]] - The `this` keyword in a class method refers to the instance of the class.

7. [[Inheritance]] - JavaScript classes support inheritance through the `extends` keyword. A class can inherit from another class, gaining access to its methods and properties.

8. [[Super Keyword]] - The `super` keyword is used to call corresponding methods of the parent class. This is especially useful in the case of a constructor of a subclass.

9. [[Getters and Setters]] - Classes can include getter and setter methods to control how class data is accessed and manipulated.

10. [[Static Methods]] - Static methods are class-level methods, they are not callable on instances of the class, instead, they're called on the class itself.

11. [[Static Properties]] - Static properties (class properties) are properties of the class itself, not of instances of the class.

12. [[Private Class Fields]] - JavaScript classes can also have private fields, denoted by a `#` in their name. Private fields can't be accessed outside of the class body.

13. [[Private Methods]] - Similar to private fields, JavaScript also supports private methods. Private methods are also marked with `#` and cannot be accessed outside of the class.

14. [[Public Class Fields]] - Public fields are fields that are always created in the class instance, they're written without a `#`.

15. [[Method Overriding]] - In object-oriented programming, method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.

16. [[Abstract Classes]] - Abstract classes are base classes from which other classes may be derived. They may not be instantiated directly.

17. [[Polymorphism]] - Polymorphism is a concept where we can use methods of a class in its subclasses.

18. [[Class Expressions]] - Similar to function expressions, class expressions allow you to define an unnamed (anonymous) class for use in an expression.

19. [[Mixin Classes]] - Mixins are a way of building up classes from reusable components. They're used in JavaScript to cope with the fact that JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance.

20. [[Hoisting with Classes]] - Unlike functions, JavaScript classes are not hoisted. This means you need to declare a class before you can instantiate objects from it.
