Sure, here are 20 concepts related to Single Page Applications (SPAs) in JavaScript:

1. [[Single Page Applications (SPAs)]] - SPAs are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update it as the user interacts with the app.

2. [[AJAX]] - AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technology that allows for data exchange with a server, and updating parts of a web page without reloading the whole page, fundamental for SPAs.

3. [[Client-side Routing]] - Unlike traditional web apps, SPAs use client-side routing. This means the necessary code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is retrieved with a single page load, or dynamically loaded as needed, giving a smoother user experience.

4. [[Framework-Library Choices]] - Frameworks and libraries such as React.js, Angular.js, and Vue.js are popular choices to build SPAs.

5. [[JSON APIs]] - SPAs often interact with back-end servers via JSON APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for data operations.

6. [[State Management]] - State management in SPAs can become complex due to user interactions happening in one page. Libraries like Redux and Vuex help manage this state effectively.

7. [[Hash Routing]] - Hash routing is a common technique in SPAs where changing the URL hash does not trigger a page reload, but instead a different view of the application is rendered.

8. [[HTML5 History API]] - The HTML5 History API allows for navigation in an SPA without causing page reloads, maintaining the single page application feel.

9. [[Server-Side Rendering (SSR)]] - Server-side rendering can be used with SPAs for improving initial page load performance and better SEO by rendering the application on the server on the first request.

10. [[Lazy Loading]] - Lazy loading is a pattern where you only load what's necessary for the initial page view, which can help performance in an SPA.

11. [[Component-Based Architecture]] - Modern SPAs are often built using a component-based architecture, where the UI is divided into reusable components.

12. [[CORS]] - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated.

13. [[Authentication]] - In SPAs, authentication can be a challenge because of the single-page nature. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth can be used to handle authentication.

14. [[Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)]] - PWAs are a type of SPA that are designed to work offline and provide a native app-like experience.

15. [[Axios]] - Axios is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from the browser, often used in SPAs.

16. [[API Endpoints]] - An API endpoint is a specific route or URL that an API responds to. In SPAs, these are often used to handle data fetching and manipulation.

17. [[Frontend Build Tools]] - Tools like webpack, Rollup, and Parcel are often used in SPAs to bundle JavaScript files, manage dependencies, and optimize for production.

18. [[Error Handling]] - Error handling in SPAs can be complex due to the single-page nature of the application. Errors need to be caught and handled gracefully to avoid breaking the application flow.

19. [[Deployment]] - Deploying SPAs can require special consideration due to their client-side nature, and can be hosted on traditional web servers or cloud services like AWS S3 or Netlify.

20. [[Loading Indicators]] - In SPAs, loading indicators are used to inform users that a process is running in the background (like data fetching), providing feedback and improving user experience.
