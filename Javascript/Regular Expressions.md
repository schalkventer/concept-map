Sure, here are 20 concepts related to regular expressions (regex) in JavaScript along with brief summaries:

1. [[Regular Expression (Regex) Definition]] - Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings in JavaScript.

2. [[Creating a Regex]] - Regular expressions in JavaScript can be created either by using a regex literal (`/pattern/flags`) or by using the `RegExp` constructor (`new RegExp(pattern, flags)`).

3. [[Testing for Matches]] - The `test()` method is used to test whether a regex pattern is found in a string.

4. [[Finding Matches]] - The `match()` method is used to retrieve all matches between a regex and a string.

5. [[Global Searches]] - The `g` flag after a regular expression is used to perform a global search for matches, not stopping after the first match is found.

6. [[Case Insensitivity]] - The `i` flag after a regular expression is used to make the search case-insensitive.

7. [[Line Break Searches]] - The `m` flag after a regular expression is used to search across multiple lines of input.

8. [[Special Characters in Regex]] - Certain characters like `.`, `\`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `^`, `$`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, `|` have special meanings in regex and need to be escaped with a backslash (`\`) if they are meant to represent the actual character.

9. [[Character Classes]] - Enclosing characters in `[]` specifies a character class. A character class matches any one character enclosed in the brackets.

10. [[Capturing Groups]] - Parentheses `()` are used to create a capturing group, which can then be referenced back using a backreference.

11. [[Alternation]] - The pipe symbol `|` is used to specify alternatives, much like an "OR" operator.

12. [[Quantifiers]] - Quantifiers like `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `?` (0 or 1), `{n}`, `{n,}`, `{n,m}` are used to specify the number of times a character or group should be matched.

13. [[Greedy and Lazy Quantifiers]] - By default, quantifiers are greedy (they match as much as they can). Making a quantifier lazy by following it with `?` makes it match as little as possible.

14. [[Anchors]] - The caret `^` matches the beginning of input, and the dollar sign `$` matches the end of input.

15. [[Word Boundaries]] - `\b` is an assertion that checks for word boundaries, such as spaces, punctuation, or the start/end of a string.

16. [[Predefined Character Classes]] - `\d` (any digit), `\D` (any non-digit), `\w` (any alphanumeric character), `\W` (any non-alphanumeric character), `\s` (any whitespace), `\S` (any non-whitespace) are predefined character classes.

17. [[Backreferences]] - Backreferences, represented as `\n`, where `n` is a number, are used to refer back to captured groups.

18. [[Lookahead and Lookbehind]] - Lookahead (`?=` for positive lookahead and `?!` for negative lookahead) and lookbehind (`?<=` for positive lookbehind and `?<!` for negative lookbehind) are used to assert that some pattern does or does not follow or precede the current position in the match.

19. [[Replace with Regex]] - The `replace()` method is used to replace matched substrings. Backreferences can be used in the replacement string.

20. [[Flags in Regex]] - Flags are used to change the searching behavior globally (`g`), case insensitively (`i`), multi-line (`m`), dot
