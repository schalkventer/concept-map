74. [[Proxy Objects]] - A proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations (e.g., property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc.

The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations (e.g. property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc).

2. [[Handler]] - The handler object is passed to the Proxy constructor. It's an object whose methods define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it.

3. [[Traps]] - The methods of the handler object are referred to as traps. These are the functions that provide property access.

4. [[Reflect API]] - The Reflect API interacts with many of the same internal methods as proxies, and can be used in conjunction with Proxies for default behaviors.

5. [[get trap]] - The get trap can intercept property accessing. It's a method that serves to get the value of a property.

6. [[set trap]] - The set trap can intercept property assignments. It's a method that serves to set the value of a property.

7. [[has trap]] - The has trap intercepts the `in` operator. It's a method that checks if a property exists.

8. [[deleteProperty trap]] - The deleteProperty trap can intercept the `delete` operator. It's a method that serves to delete a property.

9. [[apply trap]] - The apply trap intercepts function calls. It's a method that calls a target function.

10. [[construct trap]] - The construct trap intercepts constructor calls. It's a method that serves to call a target constructor.

11. [[getPrototypeOf trap]] - The getPrototypeOf trap can intercept calls to `Object.getPrototypeOf`. It's a method that serves to get the prototype of the object.

12. [[setPrototypeOf trap]] - The setPrototypeOf trap intercepts calls to `Object.setPrototypeOf`. It's a method that serves to set the prototype of an object.

13. [[isExtensible trap]] - The isExtensible trap can intercept calls to `Object.isExtensible`. It's a method that checks if an object is extensible.

14. [[preventExtensions trap]] - The preventExtensions trap can intercept calls to `Object.preventExtensions`. It's a method that makes an object non-extensible.

15. [[ownKeys trap]] - The ownKeys trap can intercept calls to `Object.getOwnPropertyNames` and `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols`. It's a method that returns the property keys of the object.

16. [[defineProperty trap]] - The defineProperty trap can intercept calls to `Object.defineProperty`. It's a method that defines a new property directly on an object, or modifies an existing property on an object.

17. [[Data Validation]] - Proxies can be used to validate the data coming into objects, offering a way to validate assignments before they occur.

18. [[Revocable Proxies]] - JavaScript provides `Proxy.revocable()`, which creates a revocable Proxy. This allows us to turn off the proxy's operations and let garbage collection take place.

19. [[Meta-programming]] - Proxies are a meta-programming feature. They allow a program to be designed in terms of itself.

20. [[Performance Considerations]] - While Proxies provide powerful functionality, they can also add overhead and decrease performance if used indiscriminately.
