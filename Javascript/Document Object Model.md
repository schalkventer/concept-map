 The DOM represents a web page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

2. [[Nodes]] - In the DOM, all parts of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text, are nodes in the document tree.

3. [[Element Nodes]] - The most common type of node is the element node. Most HTML elements become DOM element nodes in the document tree, which can be selected, added, modified, or deleted.

4. [[Text Nodes]] - Text nodes represent the text content of an element. If an element contains text, that text will be represented in the DOM as a text node.

5. [[Attributes]] - Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and come in pairs like name="value". In the DOM, they can be accessed and manipulated.

6. [[Node Properties]] - Every node in the DOM has certain properties. These properties can be used to access and change the characteristics of the DOM nodes.

7. [[Node Methods]] - Nodes in the DOM have methods which are actions that can be performed on nodes. These methods can be used to manipulate nodes.

8. [[getElementsByTagName]] - This method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name.

9. [[getElementById]] - This method returns an element with the matching id attribute.

10. [[querySelector]] These methods allow selection of elements using CSS selectors. The former returns the first match while the latter returns all matches in a NodeList.

11. [[innerHTML]] - This property can be used to get or replace the HTML content of an element.

12. [[textContent]] - This property can be used to get or replace the text content of an element.

13. [[Event Handling]] - DOM elements can have event listeners attached to them. When the event occurs, the listener executes a JavaScript function or method.

14. [[NodeList]] - This is a collection of nodes, usually returned by properties such as Node.childNodes and methods such as document.querySelectorAll().

15. [[HTMLCollection]] - This is a collection of HTML elements. Some properties and methods return an HTMLCollection, like getElementsByTagName.

16. [[Traversing the DOM]] - This involves moving up and down the DOM tree, accessing parent, child, and sibling nodes of an element.

17. [[Creating and Removing Nodes]] - The DOM API includes methods for creating new nodes, inserting them into the DOM tree, and removing existing nodes.

18. [[DOM Manipulation]] - This refers to the process of adding, modifying, or deleting elements and attributes in the DOM.

19. [[DOMContentLoaded event]] - This event fires when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

20. [[DocumentFragment]] - This is a minimal document object that has no parent. It is used as a lightweight version of Document that stores a segment of a document structure comprised of nodes just like a standard document. It's often used to improve performance for large-scale DOM manipulations.
