Suspense: A mechanism that helps components "wait" for something before they can render.

1. [[Suspense]]: A built-in component in React that lets your components "wait" for something before they can render.

2. [[Fallback Prop]]: A prop that accepts the React elements you want to render as a loading state while waiting for some operation to finish.

3. [[React.lazy]]: A function that lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. It makes it easy to code split, using Suspense to handle the loading state.

4. [[Code Splitting]]: A feature that allows you to split your code into small chunks that you can then load on demand.

5. [[Concurrent Mode]]: An enhanced mode of operation in React that allows multiple tasks to be processed in a non-blocking way. Suspense works best in conjunction with Concurrent Mode.

6. [[Resource Caching]]: In the context of Suspense, it often refers to the ability to remember and reuse data that was fetched earlier.

7. [[Suspense List]]: A component that helps control the order in which Suspense components reveal their content.

8. [[Error Boundaries]]: A technique to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the crashed component tree.

9. [[Placeholder Delay]]: The delay in milliseconds that Suspense should wait before showing the fallback.

10. [[Suspense and Fetching Libraries]]: Libraries like React Query or Relay provide data fetching capabilities that are designed to work with Suspense.

11. [[Data Fetching with Suspense]]: Suspense allows components to “wait” for something before rendering, such as waiting for data to come back from a server.

12. [[React Cache]]: An experimental package that supports caching of external async operations which works well with Suspense.

13. [[Suspense for Images]]: An experimental way of using Suspense to handle loading images.

14. [[Server Components]]: A new experimental feature in React for rendering components on the server and then sending the minimal client-side code to the client. This concept is closely tied with Suspense.

15. [[Transitions]]: A feature used with Suspense to prevent the UI from appearing to freeze during a large rendering task, which helps to create smoother user experiences.

16. [[React StartTransition]]: A function that marks state updates as transitions allowing React to keep the UI responsive.

17. [[Suspense and Routing]]: Suspense can be used with React Router to provide better user experience while navigating between routes.

18. [[Prefetching with Suspense]]: A pattern where you start loading the data for the next screen as soon as the link is visible in the viewport, and then use Suspense to show a loading state while the rest is loading.

19. [[Suspense and State Management]]: Libraries like Redux or MobX can be used in conjunction with Suspense to handle global state in a Suspense-friendly manner.

20. [[React Suspense SSR]]: Suspense support for Server Side Rendering (SSR), allowing the server to send fully rendered pages to the client which can then be hydrated.
