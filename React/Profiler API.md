 Profiler API: Used to collect timing information about each component thatâ€™s rendered in order to identify performance bottlenecks in React applications

1. [[Profiler API]]: A way to collect timing information about each component that's rendered in order to identify performance bottlenecks in React applications.

2. [[React.Profiler]]: A component available in the Profiler API that measures how often a React application renders and what the "cost" of rendering is.

3. [[onRender Callback]]: A function that React calls any time a component within the profiled tree commits an update. It receives parameters like phase, actualDuration, startTime, etc.

4. [[Phase]]: One of the parameters received in onRender callback, representing either "mount" (if the tree just mounted) or "update" (if it re-rendered).

5. [[Actual Duration]]: A parameter that reports the time spent rendering the committed update. This indicates how well the subtree makes use of memoization (e.g., React.memo, useMemo, shouldComponentUpdate).

6. [[Base Duration]]: Represents the time it would take to render the components being profiled without memoization.

7. [[Start Time]]: When React began rendering this update.

8. [[Commit Time]]: When React committed this update.

9. [[Interactions]]: The objects representing the 'events' which caused the component to re-render.

10. [[Profiling in DevTools]]: React DevTools provide a visualization of profiling data collected from the Profiler API.

11. [[Recording a Profiling Session]]: A feature available in React DevTools that allows you to record a set of interactions and analyze the rendering that results from them.

12. [[Flamegraph]]: A visualization in React DevTools that shows how components are rendering.

13. [[Ranked Chart]]: A visualization in React DevTools that helps to identify the components that took the longest total time to render during the profiling session.

14. [[Component Filtering]]: A feature in React DevTools Profiler that allows filtering out components that took less than a certain amount of time to render.

15. [[Interactions Tracking]]: The Profiler API also allows tracking the causes of an update, although it requires additional configuration.

16. [[Profiling in Production]]: Profiling adds some additional overhead, so it's disabled in the production build of React by default. 

17. [[Measure Performance with Why Did You Render]]: An open-source library that can be used in combination with the Profiler API to identify avoidable re-renders.

18. [[Concurrent Mode Profiling]]: Concurrent Mode is a set of new features in React that help to improve the "responsiveness" of user interfaces, and Profiler API also helps to identify how components render in this mode.

19. [[Suspense and Profiling]]: React's Suspense feature allows components to "wait" for something before they can render, and the Profiler API can help to measure this "waiting" time.

20. [[Comparing Profiling Sessions]]: With the help of React DevTools, developers can record multiple profiling sessions and compare them to identify any potential performance regressions.
