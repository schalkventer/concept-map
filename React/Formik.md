[[Formik]]: A small library that helps with handling form state, input validation, and error messages.

1. [[Formik Component]]: This is the primary component that wraps around your form and manages the form's state and submission process.

2. [[Values]]: This is an object maintained by Formik which holds the state of all the form's fields.

3. [[Errors]]: This is an object that Formik uses to keep track of validation errors for the form.

4. [[Touched]]: This is an object that Formik uses to keep track of which fields have been visited.

5. [[handleSubmit]]: This is a Formik method that is typically passed to the form's onSubmit prop. It takes care of validating the form's values and potentially submitting the form.

6. [[handleChange]]: This is a Formik method that handles changes to the form's values.

7. [[handleBlur]]: This is a Formik method that handles the form's blur events.

8. [[validateOnBlur]]: This is a Formik configuration option that triggers validation when a field is blurred.

9. [[validateOnChange]]: This is a Formik configuration option that triggers validation when a field's value changes.

10. [[ValidationSchema]]: A configuration option where you can define a Yup schema for validation.

11. [[InitialValues]]: This is a prop that initializes the form's fields with some default values.

12. [[isSubmitting]]: A boolean that Formik maintains to indicate whether the form is currently being submitted.

13. [[Field Component]]: A built-in form field wrapper in Formik that automatically hooks into Formik's props.

14. [[Form Component]]: This is a built-in component that automatically hooks into Formik's handleSubmit.

15. [[FastField Component]]: This is similar to Field, but optimized for performance. It's used for large forms with frequent updates.

16. [[FormikContext]]: This is a context object which you can use to access Formik's state and methods in deeply nested components.

17. [[withFormik]]: A higher-order component that wraps around your form component and provides Formik's props.

18. [[useFormik]]: This is a hook that returns Formik's props without the need to use the Formik component.

19. [[ErrorMessage]]: A component provided by Formik to display error messages for individual form fields.

20. [[setFieldValue]]: A function that allows you to manually change the value of a specific field. It's especially useful for complex interactions.
