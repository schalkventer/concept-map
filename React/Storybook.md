Storybook: A development environment for UI components, often used with React for developing and designing components outside your app.

1. [[Storybook]]: An open-source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React, Vue, Angular, and more. It's a development environment for creating component examples.

2. [[Stories]]: Individual versions of a component. They are the smallest unit in Storybook.

3. [[Component-Driven Development (CDD)]]: A practice that uses isolated component development to construct UIs.

4. [[Storybook Decorators]]: Provide a way to wrap stories in "decorators" to add additional rendering functionality.

5. [[Controls]]: Allow designers and developers to experiment with components in different states by dynamically adjusting the props passed to them.

6. [[Actions]]: Help you verify interactions when building UI components in Storybook. They are used to display data received by event handlers in Storybook's UI.

7. [[Storybook Addons]]: Extend the core functionality of Storybook. They can be used to add a panel to Storybook's UI, interact with the Canvas or the Manager, or add CLI functionalities.

8. [[Docs]]: An addon that auto-generates documentation from your stories.

9. [[Canvas]]: The preview area in Storybook where your components (i.e., stories) are rendered.

10. [[Viewport]]: An addon that allows your stories to be displayed in different sizes and layouts in Storybook. This helps build responsive components.

11. [[Knobs]]: An older addon that allows you to edit React props dynamically using Storybook's UI.

12. [[Storybook Configurations]]: A set of files that configures and customizes the Storybook environment.

13. [[Story Source]]: An addon that shows the source code of the story.

14. [[Storybook Manager]]: The UI where you search, navigate, and customize stories in Storybook.

15. [[Hot Module Replacement (HMR)]]: A feature of Storybook that updates your stories without a page refresh whenever you make changes.

16. [[Storyshots]]: An addon for easy snapshot testing of stories with Jest.

17. [[ArgTypes]]: Define the arguments (args) of a component to generate controls and define the DocsPage information.

18. [[Storybook Composition]]: Use multiple Storybook instances together so you can develop components across different frameworks and projects in isolation.

19. [[Storybook Deployer]]: An addon to help deploy your Storybook as a static web application.

20. [[Component Story Format (CSF)]]: The recommended way to write stories. It is an open standard based on ES6 modules that makes it portable between different tools.
