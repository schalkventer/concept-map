CSS-in-JS: A pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of defined in external files

1. [[Inline Styles]]: CSS-in-JS started with the concept of inline styles, which allows styles to be written directly within JavaScript code. 

2. [[Style Objects]]: In React, CSS can be written as JavaScript objects, where property names are written in camelCase.

3. [[Styled Components]]: A popular library for CSS-in-JS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code in your JavaScript, creating reusable and themable components.

4. [[Emotion]]: Another popular CSS-in-JS library that's similar to styled-components. Emotion has a slightly different syntax and includes performance optimizations.

5. [[Component-scoped Styles]]: One advantage of CSS-in-JS is that styles are scoped to a specific component, preventing styles from unintentionally affecting other components.

6. [[CSS Prop]]: Both styled-components and Emotion offer a CSS prop, allowing you to write CSS directly on a component.

7. [[Theming]]: Many CSS-in-JS libraries include built-in ways to provide a theme (a set of variables, such as colors or fonts) that can be used across all of your styles.

8. [[Tagged Template Literals]]: The syntax used by libraries like styled-components and Emotion, allowing you to write CSS inside JavaScript template strings.

9. [[Server-Side Rendering (SSR)]]: Some CSS-in-JS libraries include ways to extract the CSS on the server, allowing your styles to be included in the initial HTML and preventing a flash of unstyled content.

10. [[Critical CSS]]: CSS-in-JS libraries can figure out exactly which styles are used on a page and only include those, reducing the amount of CSS that needs to be loaded.

11. [[Vendor Prefixing]]: Many CSS-in-JS libraries automatically add vendor prefixes to your styles, ensuring compatibility across different browsers.

12. [[JavaScript Interpolation]]: With CSS-in-JS, JavaScript expressions can be directly interpolated into your styles, allowing for more dynamic styling based on props or state.

13. [[Global Styles]]: Even though CSS-in-JS is typically scoped to a component, you can still define global styles that apply to the entire document.

14. [[Dynamic Styles]]: CSS-in-JS allows you to create styles that are based on props, state, or context, making your styles dynamic and reactive to your application's state.

15. [[Performance Optimization]]: CSS-in-JS libraries often include performance optimizations, such as only injecting styles for components that are currently rendered.

16. [[CSS-in-JS libraries]]: There are many libraries available for CSS-in-JS, each with different syntaxes, features, and optimizations.

17. [[Media Queries]]: Like in regular CSS, CSS-in-JS allows for media queries to adjust styles based on viewport sizes, device capabilities, etc.

18. [[Keyframes]]: CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components and Emotion allow you to define keyframes for animations directly within your JavaScript code.

19. [[Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements]]: CSS-in-JS libraries support pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, enabling advanced styling techniques.

20. [[CSS Variables]]: CSS-in-JS solutions typically support CSS Custom Properties (also known as CSS variables), allowing for more dynamic and reusable styles.
