 [[JSX]]: A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML in your React code

1. [[JSX Syntax]]: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like XML or HTML, which is used in React to describe the UI of the component.

2. [[Babel Transpilation]]: Babel is used to convert JSX into regular JavaScript that the browser can understand.

3. [[JSX Expressions]]: You can embed JavaScript expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces.

4. [[JSX Elements]]: These are the basic building blocks of React applications, which can represent HTML elements, user-defined components, or plain text.

5. [[JSX Components]]: Components in React can either be defined as functions or classes and can return JSX elements.

6. [[Element Attributes vs. Props]]: JSX elements can have attributes, similar to HTML elements, which can be accessed within the component as properties (props).

7. [[Nested Elements]]: JSX tags can be nested inside other tags to form a tree-like structure, similar to HTML.

8. [[Rendering JSX]] JSX elements can be rendered to the actual DOM using ReactDOM.render() method.

9. [[React.Fragment]]: It's a common pattern in JSX to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

10. [[JSX Spread Attributes]]: You can use the spread operator (...) in JSX to spread the properties of an object into separate props.

11. [[Children in JSX]]: Children are elements that are nested within other elements. 

12. [[Boolean Attributes]]: In JSX, you can specify boolean attributes using a simplified syntax.

13. [[JSX Keys]]: When rendering an array of elements, each element should have a unique "key" prop to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

14. [[React Components]] vs. React Elements: While components are the functions or classes that return JSX elements, the elements themselves are objects that describe what should be rendered on the screen.

15. [[Self-closing Tags]]: JSX tags may be self-closed if they don't have any children, similar to XML or HTML.

16. [[Inline Styles]]: In JSX, the style attribute accepts a JavaScript object rather than a CSS string.

17. [[Event Handling]]: JSX handles events differently than HTML. Event handlers are camelCased and are passed instances of SyntheticEvent, React's cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event.

18. [[JSX without React]]: Although JSX is most commonly used with React, it can be used with other libraries or even without React, as long as the JSX transpiler is set up correctly.

19. [[React.createElement]]: This function is what JSX compiles down to. It creates and returns a new React element of the given type.

20. [[Null and Undefined in JSX]]: When null or undefined is included in JSX, it is ignored, making it useful for conditionally rendering content.
