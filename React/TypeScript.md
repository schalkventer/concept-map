React with TypeScript: Using TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, in your React applications for better developer experience and type safety

1. [[TypeScript]]: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types to the language. It's widely used in React applications for improved developer experience and code reliability.

2. [[Static Typing]]: The process of annotating variables, functions, objects and components with their types.

3. [[Type Inference]]: TypeScript's ability to automatically detect and assign types based on the values of your variables and expressions.

4. [[Type Aliases]]: User-defined types that can be used to represent more complex type structures or to create shorthand notations.

5. [[Interface]]: A TypeScript structure that defines the contract for classes or objects. It's often used in React to type props.

6. [[Generics]]: A tool that allows you to create reusable components or functions that can work over a variety of types, not just one.

7. [[Union Types]]: A type that can be one of several types. Useful for typing components that can accept different types of props.

8. [[Type Assertion]]: A way to tell the TypeScript compiler to treat a value as a different type, for example when you know the type of a value more specifically than TypeScript can infer.

9. [[Type Guards]]: TypeScript constructs that narrow down the types of variables within conditional blocks.

10. [[JSX.Element]]: The type that represents a JSX element in TypeScript.

11. [[React.FC]]: A type definition for functional components in TypeScript.

12. [[Type Declaration Files]]: Files with a .d.ts extension that provide type information for JavaScript libraries that do not have built-in TypeScript support.

13. [[TSLint]]: A linter for TypeScript code that can detect potential errors and style issues.

14. [[tsconfig.json]]: The configuration file for TypeScript compiler options in a project.

15. [[Discriminated Unions]]: A pattern for working with union types that makes it easier to correctly type functions that take union-typed parameters.

16. [[Optional Types]]: TypeScript allows for optional properties in type definitions, which can be useful for optional props in React components.

17. [[Type vs Interface]]: The choice between using 'type' or 'interface' for type definitions, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

18. [[Type Compatibility]]: TypeScript's way of comparing types for assignments and function calls, based on their shapes.

19. [[Strict Mode]]: A compiler option in TypeScript that enables a stricter type checking and more rigorous type inference.

20. [[Type Narrowing]]: TypeScript's ability to progressively narrow down the type of a variable within conditional blocks.
