 Context API: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level

1. [[Context API]]: The overarching concept in React's Context API. It allows for data to be passed down through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

2. [[Context.Provider]]: A component type in the context API. The provider takes a value prop and passes it down to all descendants in the tree that are consumers of this context.

3. [[Context.Consumer]]: A component type in the context API. Consumers subscribe to changes in the context's value and re-render whenever that value changes.

4. [[Context Object]]: Created using React.createContext(). The object includes a Provider and a Consumer component that are used to share values and subscribe to changes.

5. [[Context value]]: The data or functions that are passed through a context's provider and are available to the context's consumers.

6. [[Default Value]]: The value that will be used by the context if no provider is found in the component tree. Defined during the creation of the context object.

7. [[React.createContext]]: A function in the React API used to create a new context object.

8. [[useContext]]: A Hook that lets you subscribe to React context within a function component.

9. [[Context.Provider]]: Component that enables context to be shared to child components.

10. [[Context.Consumer]]: Component that enables a child to consume the data from the context.

11. [[Nested context]]: Contexts can be nested in order to share multiple values, or to override values deeper in the tree.

12. [[Context propagation]]: The mechanism through which a context's value is passed down through the component tree.

13. [[Context isolation]]: Context allows you to manage state in an isolated manner, ensuring that unrelated parts of the application don't inadvertently affect each other.

14. [[Updating context]]: While not directly part of the API, strategies for updating context values (such as using a state management library or a component's state) are crucial for using context effectively.

15. [[Context in class components]]: Though useContext() makes consuming context simpler in function components, class components can still consume context using static contextType or <Context.Consumer>.

16. [[Higher-Order Components (HOCs)]]: Prior to the introduction of context and Hooks, HOCs were often used to inject data at different points in a component tree, similar to what context now does more easily.

17. [[Performance considerations]]: Since any context consumer will re-render when the context value changes, it can be important to optimize how context is used to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

18. [[Context vs. Redux]]: Redux is a popular state management library for React that can also be used for sharing data across a component tree. However, context can be simpler for smaller applications or certain types of state.

19. [[Global state]]: One common use of context is to create a global state for an application, where any component can access and modify any part of the state.

20. [[Multiple contexts]]: An application can have multiple separate contexts. This can be useful for separating different types of state, such as user data vs. UI state.
